IMPORTANT: I am unable to work on projects right now as I am currently in school and have to focus on my studies. That being said this does not mean that I will stop completely and will continue in the summer.

This repository contains the projects I have worked on so far. It includes games and bank simulations.

What the files do specifically:
- The TransactionRecord class directly connects with the bankAccount class because it works the same way as a real bank account. You can deposit, withdraw, and add money to savings. This class uses the ArrayList<> data structure to keep track of the transactions being made on the account.
- The text based game is the simplest as this can get because all you do is push the enter key and occasionally enter values. 
- The number game is a guessing game where you enter a number and if the number is too high it will print "Too high" and if it is too low, then it will print "Too low". You keep going until you guess it or run out of moves.
